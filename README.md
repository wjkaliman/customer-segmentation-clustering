# Customer Segmentation (Clustering)

## Project Overview
This project applies **K-Means clustering** to perform customer segmentation, grouping similar customers based on their attributes. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, determining the optimal number of clusters using the elbow and silhouette methods, visualizing clusters with PCA, and evaluating clustering performance with key metrics.

---

## Objectives
- Apply unsupervised learning for customer segmentation.
- Use feature scaling to prepare data for clustering.
- Determine the optimal number of clusters using:
  - **Elbow Method**
  - **Silhouette Score**
- Visualize clusters in 2D space using PCA.
- Evaluate clustering quality with relevant metrics.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **pandas**, **numpy**
- **scikit-learn**
- **matplotlib**, **seaborn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## Dataset
This example uses the **Iris dataset** from scikit-learn as a proxy for customer data.  
The workflow is dataset-agnostic â€” you can replace the input data with a real customer dataset (e.g., Mall Customers, Wholesale Customers) to replicate the process.
